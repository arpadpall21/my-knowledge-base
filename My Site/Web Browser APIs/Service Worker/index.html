<h2 style="color:green;"><u> Remember This : </u></h2>
    
<h2 style="color:green;"><u> Description and Demonstration : </u></h2>
    <p> - a Service Worker is a <u>local Proxy Server</u> that sits between the site and the server <u>(works over HTTPS or localhost)</u></p>
    <p> - it is designed to enhance offline experience (<b>P</b>rogressive <b>W</b>eb <b>A</b>pps are based on this technology) offline content loading, backgrouns sync, push notifications, etc... </p>
    <p><u><b> Lifecycle: </b></u></p>
    <p> - a document 'installs' the service worker through 3 steps <u>Register</u> -&gt; <u>Install</u> -&gt; <u>Activate</u> </p>
    <p> - once the Service Worker is activated it <u>permanently stays with the browser as local Proxy Server</u> so after this point it controls the traffic within its scope (just like a fully featured server)</p> 
    <p> - if a new Service Worker is available (ex: sw file is modified or replaced) the new worker will wait until the old worker fully finishes then takes its place </p>
    <p><u><b> Service Worker Scope: </b></u></p>
    <p> - the Service Worker Scope determines the pages that the Service Worker controls (ex: if the Service Worker scope is the root it controls all pages on the origin) </p>
    <p> - pages controlled by the Service Worker are called 'Service Worker Clients' </p>
