        man-in-the-middle attack
      </td>
      <td>
        - a hacker evasdropping between to pairs on the network
      </td>
      <td>
        - use secure encryption techniques like HTTPS <br>
        - use VPN <br>
        - be wary of using public WiFI

        (Distributed) Denial Of Service ((D)DOS)
      </td>
      <td>
        - Overloading a system on the network with large amounts of request until it stops working <br>
        - DDOS (Distributed) means using different (lots of) network nodes to overload a targeted system
      </td>
      <td>
        - use CDN, distribute your service, it's harder to target sevaral distributed services <br>
        - use DDOS anti softwares, these softwares can recognize and block traffic from malicious sources <br>
        - use load balancers, these guys distribute traffic between servers and can be configured to filter out thse types of attacks <br>
        - use firewalls, to monitor and blacklist these type of sources <br>
        - use rate limiting, this technique limits the number of request from a single client <br>
        - have an incident response plan, plan what to do in case of a DDOS attack

        SQL injection
      </td>
      <td>
        - injectin SQL script in the input field what the sql server execute as SQL command
      </td>
      <td>
        - parametrize SQL queries, provide the user with interfaces where sql parameters can be configured instead of sql commands <br>
        - imput validation, implement input validation on both client & server side (ex: allow only non comand characters) <br>
        - use least privilege access, so the user have access only what it needs <br>
        - setup security measures on DB side like instruction detection, firewall ect...

        cross-site scripting (XSS)
      </td>
      <td>
        - injecting malitious javascript code into another website (the injected code can steal sensitive informations) <br>
        - ex: <span class="openable">injecting script through comments<div>
            <p> - a website allows users to post comments on articles, the comment section allows users to enter text, which is then displayed on the web page for other users to see </p>
            <p> - the attacker injects the following script on the comment section <mark>&lt;script&gt;alert('Your account has been hacked!');&lt;/script&gt;</mark> </p>
            <p> - when another user views the comments, the script is execute in his browser the 'Your account has been hacked!' message is displayed </p>
          </div></span>
      </td>
      <td>
        - imput validation, implement input validation on both client & server side (ex: allow only alphanumerical characters) <br>
        - output encoding, making sure that the content is not interpreted as HTML or JavaScript code <br>
        - HTTPOnly cookies, cookies are accessible through HTTP request only (not accessed by client side scripting) <br>
        - using sanitization libraries, the libs sanitize user input and filter out XSS attacks (DOMPurify, OWASP Java Encoder) <br>
        - implementing CSP (content security policies), implement CORS policies
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
      </td>
      <td>
        - attacker sends a malicious form request in order to change the server content <br>
        - we assume that the attacker cracked the session token for this attack
      </td>
      <td>
        - implement <span class="openable">CSRF protection<div>
          <p> - the server generates a CSRF token and sends it to the client </p>
          <p> - the client indludes the CSRF token in all form request (as hidden form field) </p>
          <p> - with all form requests the server verifies the CSRF token along with the session token </p>
        </div></span> (we usually include CSRF protection in form requests where the client modifies the server content (ex: for getting data no CSRF protection needed)) <br>
        - do not transmit CSRF tokens in cookies (recommended to use a custom header)
