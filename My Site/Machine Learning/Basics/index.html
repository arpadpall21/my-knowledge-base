        <td> overfitting / underfitting </td>
        <td>
          - (Overfitting) When a model learns the training data too well, capturing noise and outliers, resulting in poor generalization to new data <br>
          - (Underfitting) When a model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data, leading to poor performance on both training and new data

      <tr>
        <td> positive VS negative class </td>
        <td> - In binary classification, the positive class is positive outcome of the target variable VS negative class is negative outcome of the target variable (email spam ex: <mark>spam</mark> VS <mark>not spam</mark>) </td>

    <h2 class="header"> Types of Machine Learning </h2>
    <p> - Supervised Learning: </p>
    <p class="indent-lv1"> - The model is trained on a labeled dataset, meaning that each training example is paired with an output label. The model learns to map inputs to the correct output (ex: classification (spam detection), regression (predicting house prices))</p>
    <p> - Unsupervised Learning: </p>
    <p class="indent-lv1"> - The model is trained on an unlabeled dataset and must find patterns and relationships in the data without any guidance on what the output should be (ex: clustering (document clustering), annomaly detection) </p>
    <p> - Reinforced Learning: </p>
    <p class="indent-lv1"> - The model learns by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. The goal is to learn a policy that maximizes cumulative rewards over time (ex: Game playing (AlphaGo), Robotics, Self-driving cars)</p>
    <p> - Generative Learning: </p>
    <p class="indent-lv1"> - The model learns to generate new data that is similar to the training data (ex: image, text, and music generation) </p>
