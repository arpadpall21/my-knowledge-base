    <h2 class="header"> Types of Machine Learning </h2>
    <p> - Supervised Learning: </p>
    <p class="indent-lv1"> - The model is trained on a labeled dataset, meaning that each training example is paired with an output label. The model learns to map inputs to the correct output (ex: classification (spam detection), regression (predicting house prices))</p>
    <p> - Unsupervised Learning: </p>
    <p class="indent-lv1"> - The model is trained on an unlabeled dataset and must find patterns and relationships in the data without any guidance on what the output should be (ex: clustering (document clustering), annomaly detection) </p>
    <p> - Reinforced Learning: </p>
    <p class="indent-lv1"> - The model learns by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. The goal is to learn a policy that maximizes cumulative rewards over time (ex: Game playing (AlphaGo), Robotics, Self-driving cars)</p>
    <p> - Generative Learning: </p>
    <p class="indent-lv1"> - The model learns to generate new data that is similar to the training data (ex: image, text, and music generation) </p>

    <!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
    <h2 class="header"> Machine Learning Tools </h2>
    <p> - 1) AI Services </p>
    <p class="indent-lv1"> - Ready to use AI service for common tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing, and recommendation systems, accessible via APIs (ex: Azure Cognitive Services, AWS AI Services) </p>
    <p> - 2) ML Services </p>
    <p class="indent-lv1"> - Offer tools and frameworks for building, training, and deploying custom machine learning models (ex: Azure Machine Learning, AWS SageMaker) </p>
    <p> - 3) Frameworks, Libraries, and Infrastructure </p>
    <p class="indent-lv1"> - Facilitate the development and deployment of machine learning models (ex: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn) </p>
    <hr>
    <!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
    <h2 class="header"> MCP (Model, Context, Protocol) </h2>
    <p> - The MCP is essentially an LLM proxy protocol that defines how to interact with the model, how to structure the communication to optimize the model's performance and accuracy </p>
    <p> - Features: </p>
    <p class="indent-lv1"> - Expose specific capabilities of the model to the user (ex: model trained for coding exposes such features) </p>
    <p class="indent-lv1"> - Remember Context (ex: user preferences, historical data, environmental conditions) </p>
    <p class="indent-lv1"> - Optimize the communication protocol to enhance the model's performance and accuracy (ex: structuring prompts in a way that the model can understand better) </p>
    <p class="indent-lv1"> - Provide a standardized way to interact with different models and services, making it easier for developers to integrate and utilize various AI capabilities </p>
    <p class="indent-lv1"> - Etc... </p>

<!--
    RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
        - R: Retrieval Relevant information from external sources (knowledge bases, databases, documents, etc...)
        - A: Augmented Generation -> augmenting your prompt with the retrieved information
        - G: Generation -> LLM generates a response based on the augmented prompt


    - Ex: you pass a documnet and ask a question about it, the model retrieves relevant information from the document and uses it to generate a more accurate and contextually relevant response

    - Basically we include external knowledge bases in our query to the LLM 






###
    - Keyword Search VS Semantic Search
        - Keyword Search: search based on exact keyword matches (ex: searching for "car" will only return results that contain the word "car")
        - Semantic Search: search based on the meaning and context of the query (ex: searching for "car" might also return results related to "automobile", "vehicle", etc...)

    - Techniques for Query validation:
        - Keyword Matching: checking if the retrieved information contains specific keywords related to the query
        - Semantic Similarity: using techniques like cosine similarity to measure the semantic similarity between the query
        - Trained Classifier: training a machine learning model to classify the relevance of retrieved information based on features extracted from the query and the retrieved data
